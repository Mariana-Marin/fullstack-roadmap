// 89. Replace $ in Expression to Make True
// 
// Write a JavaScript program to check whether it is possible to replace $ in a given expression x $ y = z with one of the four signs +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.  
// For example x = 10, y = 30 and z = 300, we can replace $ with a multiple operator (*) to obtain x * y = z
